        ]
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>



## Template Versioning

### Version Lifecycle

Templates follow a structured lifecycle to ensure reliable API operations:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Draft"
    icon="edit"
  >
    **Editable**: Freely modify fields, descriptions, and settings
    **Testing**: Upload images to test extraction quality
    **Private**: Not available for API calls until published
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Published"
    icon="check-circle"
  >
    **Immutable**: Cannot be modified directly
    **Live**: Available for API extractions
    **Stable**: Guaranteed consistent behavior for integrations
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Archived"
    icon="archive"
  >
    **Preserved**: Maintains history but not actively used
    **Reference**: Available for rollback if needed
    **Inactive**: No longer receives API traffic
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Versioning Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic Draft Creation" icon="magic-wand">
    **Smart Versioning**: When you edit a published template, the system automatically creates a new draft version
    
    **Benefits**:
    - Protects live API integrations
    - Allows safe testing of changes
    - Preserves working versions
    
    **Workflow**:
    1. Click "Edit" on published template
    2. System creates new draft version automatically  
    3. Make your changes in the draft
    4. Test thoroughly before publishing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version Control" icon="git-branch">
    **Version Numbers**: Semantic versioning (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
    
    **Publishing Flow**:
    - Draft → Published (becomes live)
    - Previous version → Archived (preserved for rollback)
    
    **Rollback Capability**:
    - Switch between any version instantly
    - Restore archived versions as new drafts
    - Complete change history tracking
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Version Control" icon="code">
    **Version-Specific Calls**: Specify exact versions for production stability
    
    **Default Behavior**: Uses latest published version if no version specified
    
    **Production Tip**: Always specify version numbers in production to avoid unexpected changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Version Management Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Initial Version">
    New templates start as Draft v1. Define fields, test, and publish when ready.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Edit published templates automatically creates new draft versions. Original remains live.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Changes">
    Use draft version for testing. Previous published version continues serving API calls.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Update">
    Publishing draft makes it live and archives the previous version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor & Rollback">
    Monitor performance. Can instantly rollback to previous versions if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Template Performance

### Key Metrics to Monitor

<AccordionGroup>

  
  <Accordion title="Success Rate" icon="percentage">
    **Target**: Above 90% for reliable templates
    
    **Optimization Strategies**:
    - Make optional fields truly optional
    - Use conditional logic for edge cases
    - Test with diverse content samples
    - Monitor field-specific failure patterns
  </Accordion>

  
  <Accordion title="Processing Time" icon="clock">
    **Typical Range**: 1-3 seconds per extraction
    
    **Factors Affecting Speed**:
    - Image size and complexity
    - Number of fields
    - Field type complexity
    - Batch size for multiple images
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Optimization

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Better Descriptions"
    icon="edit"
  >
    **Detailed field descriptions** lead to 20-30% better extraction accuracy
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Quality Images"
    icon="image"
  >
    **High-resolution, clear images** improve confidence scores significantly
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Field Optimization"
    icon="target"
  >
    **Use appropriate field types** that match your data requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Fields

Extract fields only when certain conditions are met:

```json
{
  "name": "sales_tax",
  "description": "Sales tax amount, only extract if document appears to be from US",
  "type": "number",
  "required": false,
  "conditional": true
}
```

### Multi-language Support

Templates can handle documents in different languages:

```json
{
  "name": "description",
  "description": "Product description",
  "type": "string",
  "target_language": "en"
}
```

**Features**:
- Support for 40+ languages
- Automatic language detection
- Translation to target language

### List Extraction

Extract multiple instances of the same field:

```json
{
  "name": "line_items",
  "description": "All line items from the invoice",
  "type": "object",
  "return_as_list": true,
  "subfields": [
    {"name": "description", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "quantity", "type": "number"},
    {"name": "unit_price", "type": "number"},
    {"name": "total", "type": "number"}
  ]
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Extraction Quality Issues" icon="chart-line-down">
    **Problem**: AI extractions are not accurate or reliable
    
    **Solutions**:
    - **Improve descriptions**: Add more detail about field location and format
    - **Test image quality**: Use higher resolution, better lighting
    - **Field specificity**: Be more specific about expected data format
    
    **Example Fix**:
    ```json
    // Before (vague)
    {"name": "date", "description": "The date"}
    
    // After (specific)
    {"name": "invoice_date", "description": "The invoice date in MM/DD/YYYY format, typically found in the top-right corner of the document"}
    ```
  </Accordion>
  

  
  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Results" icon="shuffle">
    **Problem**: Same image gives different results across API calls
    
    **Solutions**:
    - **Use specific versions**: Pin to exact version numbers in production
    - **Improve descriptions**: Use more detailed, unambiguous field descriptions
    - **Test variations**: Validate with multiple versions of similar content
    
    **Production Best Practice**:
    ```javascript
    // Always specify version in production
    {
      "template_id": "invoice-processor",
      "version_number": 2,  // Pin to specific version
      "image_url": "..."
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version Management Issues" icon="git-branch">
    **Problem**: Confusion about draft vs published versions
    
    **Understanding the System**:
    - **Draft**: Editable, not available for API calls
    - **Published**: Immutable, available for API calls
    - **Editing published**: Automatically creates new draft
    
    **Best Practices**:
    - Test thoroughly in draft before publishing
    - Use version numbers in production API calls
    - Monitor performance after publishing new versions
    - Keep old versions as rollback options
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Start Simple"
    icon="seedling"
  >
    Begin with 3-5 core fields using basic types, then add complexity incrementally
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Test Thoroughly"
    icon="microscope"
  >
    Use diverse, real-world images representing edge cases before publishing
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Version Control"
    icon="git-branch"
  >
    Always test new versions thoroughly and pin versions in production
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Template Design Guidelines

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, specific field names (`invoice_total` vs `total`)
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Include location, format, and context information
3. **Appropriate Types**: Match field types to expected data formats
4. **Smart Defaults**: Make fields optional unless absolutely required
5. **Version Management**: Use semantic versioning and test before publishing
