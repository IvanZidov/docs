## Core Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you get the most out of VizAPI.ai:

### Templates
Templates define what information you want to extract from your images. Each template consists of fields with descriptions, types, and extraction rules. Templates can be:
- **Pre-built**: Choose from our library of expert-crafted templates
- **Custom**: Create your own using our AI-powered visual editor
- **Versioned**: Templates support versioning for production reliability

### Extractions
An extraction is a specific instance of applying a template to visual content. Each extraction:
- Uses a specific template version
- Processes your images/documents
- Returns structured JSON data
- Becomes available as a REST API endpoint

### API Keys
VizAPI.ai uses a sophisticated API key system:
- **Main API Key**: Your primary key for dashboard and general access
- **Template-Specific Keys**: Keys that only work with specific templates
- **Environment Keys**: Different keys for development, staging, and production

### Credits
Credits power your extractions:
- Each API call consumes credits based on complexity
- Purchase credit packages through our integrated billing system
- Track usage and get notifications when running low
